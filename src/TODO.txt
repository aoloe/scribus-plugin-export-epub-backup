#ASAP

- make sure that getStylenameSanitized returns unique names

- doc->get()->scMW() should be replaced by the current window!
  ---> currDoc = ScCore->primaryMainWindow()->doc;
  ... if any... (it's used for the status bar and for managing dialogs...)

- bug to add:
  -> when replacing the font, is there any other outcome than the font being replaced? if not, please remove
     the confirmation dialog
  (SpecialChars::NBHYPHEN)
- define what the sample tests:
  - rennes_600.jpg must be included as is
  - penguin.jpg should be cropped, included once, used twice

- correctly handle images that are used multiple times in a file
  - still missing the second penguin
  - check for images that are inserted 1:1 (which don't need resizing nor cropping)
- correctly handle iamges with the same name and size but coming from different directories
- get the GUI to do something for each existing field (text color and font information)
- check that the items are not embedded or a pattern
- remove all references to OwnPage
- add support for footnotes (http://blog.epubbooks.com/183/creating-an-epub-document)
  - link and backlink
  - always at the end of the chapter
- correctly impelement captions (using the welding references?)
- "Default Paragraph Style" should be translates as p and not as p.Default_Paragraph_Style (the same for the default char style)


BEFORE 1.0

- clean up the progress bar and implement the cancel button.
- if the images are not jpg or png (or .gif?) convert them to jpg or png.
- implement TOC with the fix h\d.* style names if cezary implemention of a real TOC does not make it in 1.5
- correctly set dtb:depth with the TOC depth (TODO)
- add the font files
- font sizes: 12 pt = 16px = 1 em = 100%
- convert all colors to rgb
- optionally (?) use h1 to break into files
- detect lists (option = glyph to look for <- no use cezary's lists!); if we're on a list retain the indent 
- for images where the resolution is defined, keep the size (in px???)
- select directory where to put the ebook
- in document settings optionally define the directory where low resolution images are placed (this can be useful for pdf created for the web)
- keeping the colors of the text and the background of frames should be an option
- what happens if a char and a para style have the same name? always create a span to apply the character style?
- correctly set the language in the metadata (TODO)
- store the generated UUID in the document configuration (TODO)
- all file names must have ASCII chars only (manage the clashes when renaming)
	- Your filenames have spaces or encoded characters. If your EPUB has any spaces in filenames, be sure the spaces are properly encoded in the EPUB manifest by using "%20" in their place. Filenames may not contain periods (“.”) other than to separate the filename from its extension.
- check that the cover is correctly generated as as a jpg with 1400px height (generate a png and convert it to jpg)
- cover:
      <div>
        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" height="100%" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 600 800" width="100%">
          <image height="800" width="600" xlink:href="../Images/cover.jpeg"></image>
        </svg>
      </div>
- patch scribus to enable an identifier type in the document information (#11055)
- check that for each section a new file is created (should already be so)
- check how the exporter behaves with embedded frames
- fix the <span>s around the <br>s (cf. fm/scribus sample by cédric)



LATER
- optionally allow a special rule for (big) portrait pictures (ex.: max width = 80%)
- eventually and optionally set the chapter title as the name of the section in the epub file (TODO)
- eventually store the epu date in the document configuration (TODO)
- define the condition under which a new span builds upon the current one or replaces it. (as an example: if a font is defined and it does not change, build upon it)
- show the document infos in the export dialog
- add a checkbox to open the created epub with an application (sigil) and let it set in the preferences
- groups only containing shapes (no text nor images) should be exported as svg
- patch scribus to enable an authorFileAs the document information (lastname, first,)
	- should the document information also be in the preferences (mostly not needed, but some fields can be handy for epub in some cases
- we may need to obfuscate fonts on demand (or leave it to sigil?) (Sigil/Importers/ImportEPUB.cpp FontObfuscation; Sigil/Misc/FontObfuscation)
- QDomDocument has some limitations (like putting newlines around <span>s): in the future we should probably rather use SAX
- allow a separate folder for low-res images (this should probably be a general feature in scribus, since it also useful for web oriented PDFs: it should be carefully designed)
- load an external css
- as long as the TOC is not implemetned, use the information loaded from the css to define the titles
- show a report
  - which styles are not matching between .sla and .css?
